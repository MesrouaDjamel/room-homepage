## My process
I started the project using npx create-next-app@latest we configured the project following the instructions (use typescript, use tailwindscss, use app router...).
then I go to the tailwind.config.ts.config and set up the different colors to use in the project and the different  sizes, then I go to the layout.ts file where I import the font to use in this project I used Kumbh_Sans. and finally start coding the UI  with  Jsx (content)  and  tailwindcss (style) and I finish with javascript (interaction).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- FlexBox
- Tailwindcss Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework



### What I learned
Here are several things I learned about material tailwinds
- Setup with nextJs
- I learned how to divide do carousel with description
